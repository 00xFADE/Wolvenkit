THE WITCHER 3: WILD HUNT LEGAL RULES
Last updated: 15.05.2015

Hello and thanks for your interest in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt! These are the legal rules which we ask you to follow if you download, install or play it.

First We’ve included here a short, informal summary of each of these Rules (though it’s the full version which is legally binding).

SHORT SUMMARY: 

1. This is a legal agreement between you, dear gamer, and us, i.e. CD PROJEKT RED, regarding The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. 

2. We grant you the right to play The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and we sincerely hope you will enjoy it. We spent over 3 long years working on it, so let us add that it is our creation and remains our ownership. This will not limit you in having fun with it, will it? ;)

3. In the User Agreement you may find examples of things we ask you not to do with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (e.g. don’t use hacks). And just to be clear, for all of you doing Let’s Plays on YouTube, we are totally fine with it and yes, when you monetize it we are also fine

4.We may update this document in the future, but in such case we will post an updated version. Important: These Rules are supplemented by the User Agreement (see link below). We are not huge fans of rules but if you go BIG time against those, you may lose access to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (temporarily or permanently). We know you guys are really great, and we know nothing bad will happen, but the legal folks said the point below has to be there.

FULL VERSION (legally binding) :

1. LEGAL STUFF ABOUT THESE RULES
These ‘Rules’ are a legally binding contract between you and CD PROJEKT S.A. ul. Jagiellonska 74; 03-301, Warsaw, Poland (we will further call ourselves “CD PROJEKT RED” as CD PROJEKT S.A. is the legal entity CD PROJEKT RED is part of) regarding your use of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. IMPORTANT: please also read our CD PROJEKT RED User Agreement ( http://bar.cdprojektred.com/regulations/ ) which sets out the basic legal rules for all our games and services, including this game. Our Privacy Policy ( http://bar.cdprojektred.com/regulations/privacy_policy/ ) protects any personal information gathered from users. These Rules also supplement any terms and conditions of any digital distribution platforms, which you might use to download and play The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.

2. WHAT YOU GET WITH THE GAME
We (meaning CD PROJEKT RED) give you the personal right (called a 'licence' legally) to download, install and play The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on your personal computer as long as you follow these Rules. This licence is for your personal use only (so you can't give a sublicense to someone else) and doesn't give you ownership rights.
At all times we continue to own all of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, all in-game content, any updates or additional content for them, manuals or other materials about them and the intellectual property rights in them, including all copyright, trademarks, patents and legal things like that (all of this together we call the ‘Game’).

3.WHAT YOU CAN'T DO WITH THE GAME
Please act reasonably and don’t do anything with the Game that is against the law, these Rules or the User Agreement.
A general list of what you should not do with any of our games and services may be found in the User Agreement ( http://bar.cdprojektred.com/regulations/ ).

4. OTHER LEGAL STUFF
As you'll see, this is a short document and we may amend these Rules over time. If so, we'll post an updated version up on our website and make reasonable efforts to notify you, where possible. Once we change these Rules, it will become legally binding on you 30 days after we post it online. Please also remember that these Rules are supplemented by our User Agreement ( http://bar.cdprojektred.com/regulations/ )
These Rules are here for a reason. As a result, if you break any of them or our User Agreement, we reserve the right to cancel or suspend your access to the Game.
